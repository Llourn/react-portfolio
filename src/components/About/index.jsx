            <p>Hi, I'm Lorne. üëã</p>
            <p>
              I'm a software developer with a knack for building tools that make
              life easier for both users and dev teams. I‚Äôve worked on
              everything from internal apps that automate huge workflows, to
              real-time tournament platforms, to VR projects and online learning
              tools. These days I‚Äôm working at Hexagon, where I help maintain
              and improve a pretty complex tech stack with AngularJS, .NET, and
              a bit of AI exploration on the side.
            </p>
            <p>
              I enjoy solving tricky problems, improving performance, and
              finding ways to speed up development without sacrificing quality.
              I‚Äôve also had a chance to mentor new devs, lead projects, and work
              closely with designers and content teams to bring ideas to life.
            </p>
            <p>
              Outside of work, I‚Äôm learning Japanese (È†ëÂºµ„Çä„Åæ„Åó„Çá„ÅÜÔºÅ) and
              planning a future trip to Japan. Always happy to connect with
              folks working on cool projects‚Äîtech-related or otherwise.
            </p>
